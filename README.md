# The Local Movers

## Leveraged a Templating Design and Customized It

This website was created using a <a href="https://www.creative-tim.com/">Creative Tim</a> template, which I modified by adjusting the layout and adding my own text, images, and icons. I also incorporated the <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">Animate on Scroll</a> library to add animations to the website. The end result is a modern business website for a small moving company.

**Note:** This website is for showcase purposes only, and I have not taken the time to optimize it or ensure that it meets accessibility standards as I have with some of my earlier work.
